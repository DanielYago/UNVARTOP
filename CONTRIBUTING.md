# Contributing to UNVARTOP
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features  

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code and to track issues, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests (or numerical examples).
3. Ensure the original numerical examples can be performed.
4. Make sure your code is vectorized and it lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU GPLv3 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU GPLv3 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/DanielYago/UNVARTOP/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/DanielYago/UNVARTOP/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue. **Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
- Add `Bug` label.
- Include details about your configuration and environment (OS and Matlab's version)
- A quick summary and/or background related to the issue.
- Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
  - Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps.
- Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Additional notes, possibly including why you think this might be happening, or any solution you have tried that haven't worked.

## Submit an enhancement suggestion

We also use GitHub issues to track enhancement suggestions. Create a [new issue](https://github.com/DanielYago/UNVARTOP/issues/new) and provide the following information (in a similar way to reporting a bug):

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Add `Enhancement` label.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to other researchers.
- Specify OS and Matlab's version.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Tabs instead 2 or 4 spaces for indentation
